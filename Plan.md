- [ ] Set up JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement secure API endpoints
- [ ] Add security tests

## Phase 5: Frontend Development (Days 10-12)

### 5.1 Frontend Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React + TypeScript project
- [ ] Configure build tools and linters
- [ ] Set up component library and styling system
- [ ] Create application routing

### 5.2 Core UI Components
- [ ] Create authentication screens
- [ ] Implement dashboard layouts
- [ ] Build inventory management UI
- [ ] Develop shipment tracking UI
- [ ] Create notification center

### 5.3 API Integration
- [ ] Implement API client with Axios
- [ ] Create Redux/Context state management
- [ ] Add real-time updates with WebSockets
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states

## Phase 6: Testing & Deployment (Days 13-14)

### 6.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Complete unit test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests with Cypress
- [ ] Perform load testing with JMeter

### 6.2 AWS Deployment
- [ ] Finalize CDK deployment scripts
- [ ] Configure ECS/EKS services
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy

## Phase 7: Documentation & Final Touches (Day 15)

### 7.1 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with Swagger
- [ ] Create comprehensive README files
- [ ] Document architecture decisions and patterns
- [ ] Generate JavaDocs and TSDoc comments

### 7.2 Final Review & Optimization
- [ ] Perform security review
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Fine-tune AWS resource allocations
- [ ] Conduct UI/UX review

## Development Approach

### Agile Methodology
- Two-week sprints with defined deliverables
- Daily check-ins to track progress
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives

### Engineering Practices
- Test-driven development for critical components
- Feature branching with pull requests
- Code reviews before merging
- Continuous integration with automated tests

### Monitoring & Quality
- CloudWatch dashboards for operational metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- Regular security scans

## Getting Started Immediately

To begin implementation today:

1. **Initial Setup (2 hours)**
   ```bash
   # Create project structure
   mkdir -p AuraFlow/{inventory-service,shipment-service,notification-service,worker-service,infrastructure}
   cd AuraFlow
   
   # Initialize Git repository
   git init
   echo "# AuraFlow Project" > README.md
   echo -e "target/\n*.iml\n.idea/\n.vscode/\n*.log\n.env" > .gitignore
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project structure"
   ```

2. **First Microservice (4 hours)**
   - Create a basic Spring Boot application for inventory-service
   - Implement a single REST endpoint for product creation
   - Add basic validation and error handling
   - Write unit tests

3. **First Infrastructure Component (3 hours)**
   - Set up local DynamoDB with Docker
   - Create a basic table structure
   - Connect the inventory service to the local database
   - Implement basic CRUD operations

This plan establishes a solid foundation while demonstrating immediate progress.
