## üåü Core Concept

A robust, event-driven, full-stack platform for managing e-commerce supply chains, built entirely on a resilient, cloud-native architecture. This project emphasizes backend reliability, fault-tolerance, and scalable infrastructure - principles that power Amazon's global logistics network.

This microservices architecture leverages AWS cloud services for scalability and reliability. The React frontend communicates with Spring Boot microservices through an API Gateway. Asynchronous processing is handled via SQS queues, ensuring fault tolerance and horizontal scalability.

## üì¶ Key Features

- [ ] Role-based user authentication (Spring Security)
- [ ] RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on inventory and shipments
- [ ] Asynchronous job processing using AWS SQS and a separate worker service
- [ ] Microservices architecture (e.g., 'Inventory' and 'Shipment Tracking' services)
- [ ] Automated alerts (e.g., low stock warnings) via AWS SNS
- [ ] Storing large, unstructured report data in AWS S3
- [ ] A full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline to auto-deploy changes to AWS

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript | Component-based UI with type safety, aligns with Amazon's modern web practices |
| **Backend** | Java 21 + Spring Boot 3 | Enterprise-grade, production-ready framework used widely at Amazon |
| **Database** | AWS DynamoDB | NoSQL scalability for high-throughput supply chain data |
| **Object Storage** | AWS S3 | Reliable, durable storage for reports and large datasets |
| **Message Queue** | AWS SQS | Reliable asynchronous processing, core to Amazon's architecture |
| **Notifications** | AWS SNS | Real-time alerts and notifications at scale |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Consistent deployment environments |
| **Orchestration** | AWS ECS/EKS | Container management and auto-scaling |
| **Testing** | JUnit + Mockito, React Testing Library | Comprehensive testing for enterprise reliability |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | AWS CDK (TypeScript) | Automated infrastructure provisioning and management |
| **CI/CD** | AWS CodePipeline + CloudWatch | Amazon's native DevOps ecosystem |

## üß† Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenge 1: Event-Driven Microservices Coordination**
* **Problem:** Ensuring data consistency across multiple microservices without distributed transactions, while maintaining high availability.
* **Solution:** Implement the Saga pattern with SQS for reliable message delivery, event sourcing for audit trails, and eventual consistency with compensating transactions for rollbacks.

### **Challenge 2: High-Throughput Asynchronous Processing**
* **Problem:** Processing thousands of inventory updates per second without blocking the main application or losing data.
* **Solution:** Use SQS with dead letter queues for failed messages, implement exponential backoff retry logic, and horizontal scaling of worker services based on queue depth metrics.

### **Challenge 3: Multi-Region Fault Tolerance**
* **Problem:** Ensuring system availability even if an entire AWS region goes down.
* **Solution:** Deploy services across multiple AWS regions with DynamoDB Global Tables for data replication, Route 53 for DNS failover, and S3 cross-region replication for backup data.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 21+ and Maven 3.8+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS account with access to ECS, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, S3
